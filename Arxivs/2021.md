No work was updated about planning, so I take a look at the distributed control and see how they deal with obstacle avoidance.

(1) Neural Motion Planning for Autonomous Parking

https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.06739.pdf


There is an increasing amount of work to apply the learning-based method to motion planning. Based on the hybrid A* which is widely applied for autonomous parking, the proposed Neural Hybrid A* uses conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) to guide the node-searching.



(2) Learning Provably Robust Motion Planners Using Funnel Libraries

https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.08733.pdf



From Prof. Anirudha's group with their typical Bayes-PAC Generalization. Funnel Libraries start from their previous work:



Funnel Libraries for Real-Time Robust Feedback Motion Planning

https://arxiv.org/pdf/1601.04037.pdf



This paper combines learning-based motion planners with probabilistic guarantees of success in novel environments that hold uniformly for any dynamic disturbances within an admissible set (outer approximation of the forward reachable sets). They validate their method in the simulation for both autonomous driving navigation in the dynamic environment and drone planning under external disturbance.
