SL/Model-based control/RL

Pareto Optimal Control Strategy

off-line (computation limits)

[Optimal Time Trajectory and Coordination for Connected and Automated Vehicles coordinations (using the sharing information) of CAVs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.12183.pdf)


transportation modeling (when the car drives into the control zone then have communication and has OCP problem)

high-level: throughput maximization

low-level : energy minimizations  (optimal solution, as polynomials)

(can solve both)

mering zone (the intersection)

=> constrained optimization: minimal energy, subjects to control/state constraints, collisions (red-end/lateral)   smooth the trajectory

separation of learning and control for CPS (off-line control and on-line learning (add delay))

(noise/disturbance) -> actual CPS

OCP: derive the g to minimize total cost of actual CPS

off-line separated control strategy for problem 2 -- also the optimal for the problem 1

apply to decentralized systems
